description: Quickly commit all changes with an auto-generated message
---

Workflow for quick Git commits:

1. Check git status to see what changes are present
2. Analyze changes to generate a short, clear commit message
3. Stage all changes (tracked and untracked files)
4. Create the commit with DH7789-dev signature
5. Optionally push to remote if tracking branch exists

The commit message will be automatically generated by analyzing:
- Modified files and their purposes (components, configs, tests, docs, etc.)
- New files added and their function
- Deleted files and cleanup operations
- Overall scope of changes to determine action verb (add, update, fix, refactor, remove, etc.)

Commit message format: `[action] [what was changed]`
Examples:
- `add user authentication system`
- `fix navigation menu responsive issues`
- `update API endpoints configuration`
- `refactor database connection logic`
- `remove deprecated utility functions`

This command is ideal for:
- Quick iteration cycles
- Work-in-progress commits
- Feature development checkpoints
- Bug fix commits

The commit will include your custom signature:
```
Signed-off-by: DH7789-dev
```
